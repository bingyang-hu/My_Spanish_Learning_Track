# My_Spanish_Learning_Track


I really like learning languages in my daily life. n my way to become a softeware engineer, I feel that to some points, the foreign languages (Spanish, Janpanese..) have some commons with computer languages, espicially in grammar. Learning new languages make me feel inspired, happy and relaxed. Therefore I want to keep this piece of sweetness here so that I can come back to review and retaste.
